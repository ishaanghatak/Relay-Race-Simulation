# Relay-Race-Simulation

This repository contains the source code for a multi-threaded relay race simulation programmed in C++. The project can be run by opening the .cbp file using the CodeBlocks IDE. Some of the features implemented include: condition synchronisation, maps, mutexes, and thread-safe random number generation (Mersenne Twister).
